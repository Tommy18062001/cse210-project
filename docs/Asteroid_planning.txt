1.	What program are we going to create? Use your brainstorming from the solo checkpoint to answer this question together.
We are going to make an asteroid game for our final project. After checking and thinking about this, 
we decided to do this because we think it will make a good fit and will help us meet the requirements. 
A simplified version of the Asteroid game, A ship will be shooting asteroids and gets point for the asteroids destroyed.

2.	What technologies will we use? The answer to this question is mostly already decided. Just take a minute to remind yourselves of the language, libraries and anything else you plan on using.
